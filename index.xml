      <description>Associate Professor Chris Wright is the Academic Director of Clinical Programs for Monash University’s medical course. A/Prof Wright has a wealth of experience as an intensive care physician, programmer, and educator. We were very fortunate to have the chance to ask A/Prof Wright about his experiences in both medicine and programming.
 How did you first begin programming? The first time I learnt to code was at school in 1971.</description>

      <description>Kevin is a medical student currently undertaking a BMedSc(Hons) at Monash, and the President of MUMUS, Monash University’s medical student society. Kevin was the Puzzle Prize recipient for Puzzle No. 10C Bite Cell Scouting. We were fortunate to have the opportunity to ask Kevin some questions about his experience and views on how programming can relate to medicine.
 How did you start to learn programming and why? I was first introduced to programming / computer science in high school – we were lucky enough to have a popular Programming Club that trained students for the Australian Informatics Olympiad and other competitions.</description>

      <description>What is AORTA? AORTA, or An Open Revision Tool for Assessments, is a free and open-source web application which hosts medical learning objectives and multiple-choice questions to test those learning objectives.
Why was AORTA developed? Medical students commonly practise and test their knowledge by answering questions about things they know. Many students find answering questions to be helpful in revealing gaps in their knowledge because questions need to be answered by actively recalling information.</description>
