<p><em>Yingtong is currently a third-year medical student at Monash and the secretary of <a href="https://mumus.org/committee/">MUMUS</a>, Monash University’s medical student society. Yingtong was the Puzzle Prize recipient for <a href="https://cigmah.github.io/cgmnt/#/puzzles/7">Puzzle No. 7C, <em>Infectious Network</em></a>, and we were fortunate to have a chat with Yingtong about his programming experience and his views on how it interfaces with medicine.</em></p>

<h1 id="how-did-you-start-to-learn-programming">How did you start to learn programming?</h1>
<p>I think it’s a little bit difficult for me to say. Both of my parents studied
software engineering when they were in university - even though only one of them
works in that field now, there were lots of books on that topic around the home
when I was young. So I guess in just a general sense, it was something that
seemed interesting and something I picked up - I did some reading about it, had
some practice and it’s stuck with me since then. I started off with Java - that
was what the university courses and texts used to allow and were about. I used
it for quite some time, but in the past maybe four or five years I’ve tended
to use Python more.</p>
<h1 id="why-did-you-start-to-learn-programming">Why did you start to learn programming?</h1>
<p>I think when I was young, it was something novel, something interesting and
something to take up my time - and it’s bit of a cycle that when you improve at
something, it’s something you enjoy. But I suppose more of a reason why I do
it now is for practical reasons - having a grasp of technology helps you be
more productive with your work, helps you save time and to some extent enjoy
your work more.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-you-use-programming-for-currently">What do you use programming for currently?</h1>
<p>Currently, there’s two main areas where I use it. The first is directly involved
in my study and the second is more on the side. In terms of study, I’ve recently
been poking around with SPSS and Jupyter and things like that, doing statistics
and plotting graphs - those sorts of analyses, when you get to grips with them,
become a lot easier and a lot more versatile when you have access to the full
suite of tools at the computer’s disposal. I recently completed the <a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/study/summer-vacation-program">SPH Summer
Scholarship program</a> and I did some work in statistics and data analysis there -
that’s one of the areas where I got to practically apply programming. Even
things like making small scripts to help out with doing repetitive jobs are very
useful.</p>
<p>More generally - I’ve been involved in MUMUS a couple of years, and over the
holidays we noticed we had had real problems keeping track of membership and
communicating with our members, so I built a little membership database and an
email bulletin system to replace our old one. Another example is, last year I
was on the committee for the residents’ ball and I heard the previous year the
committee had spent a couple of hours on table allocations trying to put
everyone together, so I threw together a quick script to pool the combinations
and that saved a lot of time as well. So I think it’s just another tool to have
at your disposal.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-you-think-programming-can-be-applied-to-medicine-in-the-future">How do you think programming can be applied to medicine in the future?</h1>
<p>I guess our world is becoming increasingly technologically focused - we’ve gone
quite a way through that process already with things like many hospitals moving
towards electronic medical records. Technology’s touched many areas of our lives
and I don’t think medicine will be any different. For practitioners, there are
things like decision support tools, and for patients, for example, Monash
produced the creators of Eyenaemia, you hear a lot about that. Plenty of things
like automatic infusion pumps, medical engineering technology,
healthcare-related apps you put on your smartphone - the potential is absolutely
enormous.</p>
<h1 id="as-a-student-studying-medicine-where-do-you-see-programming-in-terms-of-your-career">As a student studying medicine, where do you see programming in terms of your career?</h1>
<p>I think computers are a tool - they’re a tool you use like a pen and paper, like
a calculator. Tools are things you can use across all fields. No matter what
field you go into, you’ll be able to use a pen and paper or a calculator, and
there will be a role for a computer. So I think just because medicine as a field
doesn’t have these super-direct head-on interactions with programming, I don’t
think it’s necessarily a problem. So in terms of where I see this heading for
me, I think principally I expect it to continue heading in the same direction as
it has - if I see a problem in my job or somewhere else where programming could
help, I’ll jump into that and see what can be improved. At the same time, there
are these intersectional areas - medical engineering, support systems etc. -
that I’d be open to exploring as well.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-your-thoughts-on-open-source-software">What are your thoughts on open source software?</h1>
<p>I am absolutely a very big fan of free, open source software. For all of the
software I write that might be useful to someone else, I try very hard to put it
somewhere, whether it’s on <a href="https://yingtongli.me/blog/">my blog</a>, a little snippet on <a href="https://github.com/RunasSudo">my GitHub</a> or whether I
make a repo for it. I license all my code under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">Creative Commons</a> for my
non-coding work. The tools are here to help us and if we’re able to help other
people and help each other with that, that’s only going to improve the outcomes we
see.</p>
<h1 id="for-fun-whatrsquos-your-favourite-programming-language-ideeditor-os">For fun: what’s your favourite programming language? IDE/Editor? OS?</h1>
<p>I do like the versatility of Python and how quick it is to get things set up and
the syntactic sugar that’s available. I think coming from Java going to Python,
it’s great for getting things done. And there’s great libraries for statistical
analysis, graphics, etc.</p>
<p>I run Linux as my daily driver - I use <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a>. I’ve used Linux for a long time, so
that’s essentially where my dev work is set up. Nowadays, I mostly just use
Emacs for simple text editing. My projects don’t tend to be that big so I
haven’t busted out a full-fledged IDE for quite some time.</p>
