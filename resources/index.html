                <h1 id="i-want-to-learn-programming-how-should-i-start">I want to learn programming. How should I start?</h1>
<p>The best way to start to learn programming varies from person to person. Some
people prefer to learn from the ground-up through reading introductory and
foundation material, while others might benefit more from a direct hands-on
approach by starting a coding project. Gradually, you&rsquo;ll find what works for you.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of learning programming is <strong>time</strong>. Many concepts
will be unfamiliar, which makes them hard to understand. A common experience for
beginners is to explore a tutorial, only to find they encounter frustrating
errors and impenetrable teaching material. This can be particularly discouraging
when you have no one to ask to explain things.</p>
<p>We advise that you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with a goal in mind.</strong> Do you want to learn how to automate some
menial tasks? Or to make a game or an app? Or to do some statistics for a
research project? These often involve different skills, and it may be easier
to focus your time on one aspect first.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for help often, from someone in real-life if you can.</strong> It is often
very helpful to have someone to guide you at the start. We run
tutorial nights to help provide some in-person guidance on assorted topics.</li>
<li><strong>Stick with it.</strong> Programming can be frustrating at times, and if you are
new, you will probably feel overwhelmed at first. Over time, these feelings
tend to subside and you&rsquo;ll feel more confident confronting unfamiliar territory.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many <strong>resources</strong> to help you learn programming. Below, we&rsquo;ve
outlined some approaches that might help you get started, depending on your
goals.</p>
<h2 id="i-dont-know-why-i-want-to-learn-programming-but-id-just-like-to-learn-it">I don&rsquo;t know why I want to learn programming, but I&rsquo;d just like to learn it.</h2>
<p>This is common. We&rsquo;d advise getting started with something visual that &ldquo;gets
something on the screen fast&rdquo;, and you&rsquo;ll learn basic concepts on the way. If
nothing else, you get to make cool art.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA">Code! Programming with
p5.js</a>
is a YouTube playlist which walks through programming using <strong>JavaScript</strong> and
a library (p5.js) to make interactive visualisations. The channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">The
Coding Train</a> is
also a great source of coding material in general. (Thanks to <a href="/blog/feature-chris-wright/">Prof
Wright</a> for
suggesting this!)</li>
</ul>
<p>It may seem useless to learn programming to make art, but it&rsquo;ll get you started
on important core concepts that&rsquo;ll help <em>a lot</em> when you branch into other areas
such as statistics, game development, or automation. You&rsquo;ll get immediate
feedback when you make art - a luxury that is unfortunately not true of every
type of programming.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-learn-programming-from-the-fundamentals">I want to learn programming from the fundamentals.</h2>
<p>There are a number of great resources online for learning programming as a
beginner from the very basics. Here&rsquo;s a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Teach Yourself Computer Science</a> - a
comprehensive collection of resources, more geared towards those pursuing
software engineering as a proper career than as a hobby, but very helpful as a
resource guide.</li>
<li><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/">MIT OpenCourseWare: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in
Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer
Science</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="i-want-to-automate-boring-tasks">I want to automate boring tasks.</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll likely benefit from learning <strong>Python</strong>, a programming language which is
very easy to start scripting your computer&rsquo;s behaviour - such as renaming a lot
of files at once, or extracting text out of webpages.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a> -
a popular book geared at using the Python programming language for pragmatic
tasks in a hands-on approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="i-want-to-practise-problem-solving">I want to practise problem solving.</h2>
<p>Programming is often a useful tool for problem-solving. Here are some resources
which compile programming problems for you to practise with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/">Rosalind</a> - a huge collection of
bioinformatics problems (ranging from very easy to very hard), helpful to
practise coding skills.</li>
<li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> - a collection of maths problems
with computational solutions.</li>
</ul>
